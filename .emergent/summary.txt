The trajectory details the transition of a Romanian FSP Navigator application from an AI engineer to a new expert. The AI engineer was tasked with assessing the app's readiness and fixing identified issues. Initially, the AI engineer performed a system health check, fixing dependency conflicts (motor, cross-env, react-feather) and a missing data file (). A critical backend authentication issue (missing  and  fields in  during user creation/login) was debugged and resolved by correctly using the  model.

Subsequently, the user reported three frontend issues: Forum Premium Node error, Minigames in Clasament error, and Badge system error. The AI engineer systematically addressed these by refactoring frontend components (, ) to use a centralized API service for authenticated calls, and by correcting the  data structure for the .

Most recently, the focus shifted to enhancing the badge display. The user requested all badges (earned/unearned) be shown with short descriptions, using a lock symbol for unearned and colors for earned, and eliminating irrelevant sections like Clasament and Verify New Badges. The AI engineer implemented these UI simplifications and visual cues, but the user still reports not seeing the badges, leading to a recurring debugging loop where the AI engineer believes it's fixed while the user experiences persistence issues. The current state is a functional backend and most frontend features, but a critical discrepancy in the badge system's visibility to the user.

<product_requirements>
The FSP Navigator is a full-stack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB) designed to assist Romanian medical professionals in obtaining licensing in Germany. It features a 6-step journey map, GDPR consent, AI-powered FSP Tutor and Email Generator, gamification (XP, levels, achievements), and PayPal integration. The initial request was to preview the app, identify bugs, and determine launch readiness.

Subsequent user requests focused on fixing specific interactive elements:
1.  **Forum Premium Node:** Resolve errors when interacting with the forum.
2.  **Minigames in Clasament (Leaderboard):** Fix errors encountered when accessing mini-games through the leaderboard.
3.  **Badge System (Trophy 0/20 banner):** Resolve errors when clicking the badge counter.
4.  **Badge Collection Display Enhancement:** Display all available badges (earned and unearned) with short descriptions. Unearned badges should be grey with a lock symbol, and earned badges should be colored without a lock. Remove the Clasament tab and Verifică Badge-uri Noi button, focusing on a simplified, essential display.
The current problem is that the user cannot see the badges despite the AI engineer's claims of functionality, indicating a persistent display issue.

<current_work>
The application currently consists of a functional FastAPI backend with JWT authentication, user management, PayPal integration, and robust API endpoints for forum and badge systems. The React frontend displays a comprehensive 6-step journey map, AI features, and gamification elements.

Recent work focused on addressing critical frontend interaction issues reported by the user:
1.  **Forum Premium Node**: Fixed by updating  to use the authenticated  service for all backend calls.
2.  **Minigames in Clasament**: Fixed by correcting the data structure in  to match the  component's expectations ( instead of ).
3.  **Badge System (Trophy 0/20 banner)**: The  component was refactored to use the authenticated  service. Subsequently, per user request, the badge display was simplified:
    *   Eliminated the Clasament tab and Verifică Badge-uri Noi button.
    *   Badges are now displayed in a simple grid.
    *   Earned badges are colored, unearned are grey with a lock icon and reduced opacity.
    *   Short descriptions are shown for each badge.
    *   The API call URL in  was corrected to include a trailing slash ().

Despite these fixes and internal testing passing, the user *still* reports not seeing the badges. The last attempt by the AI engineer was to mock badge data to force display, but this was an unsuccessful edit. The primary blocker is the discrepancy between the AI engineer's observed state and the user's observed state regarding the badge collection display, possibly due to the persistent authentication modal or a subtle UI rendering issue.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the badge collection is not visible to the user, despite the code changes and the testing agent's reports of functionality. This will involve verifying the UI rendering in the user's environment.
