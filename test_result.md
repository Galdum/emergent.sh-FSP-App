# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "Attempted to test the Payment Integration UI by clicking on the Upgrade button in the top section of the page. While the click was registered, the subscription modal did not open.

        comment: "Comprehensive testing shows that the Payment Integration UI is now working. The Upgrade button successfully opens the subscription modal with payment options. However, there's a JavaScript console error related to loading subscription plans: 'Failed to load subscription plans: TypeError: _services_api__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__.api.get is not a function'. This error affects the display of plan details in the modal, but the modal itself opens correctly."

        comment: "Code analysis confirms that the API service now has generic get/post/put/patch/delete methods implemented. This should fix the JavaScript console error related to loading subscription plans. While I couldn't directly test UI interactions due to technical limitations, the code analysis confirms that all the required fixes have been implemented correctly."

    message: "Found critical error in the frontend application. The GDPRConsentModal component is throwing a 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')' error. This is likely happening in the renderDocument function where it's trying to use document.content.replace() but the document content is undefined. The application is not loading properly due to this error. Backend API endpoints for GDPR content (/api/gdpr/privacy-policy and /api/gdpr/terms-of-service) are returning 404 errors, which suggests they are not implemented or not properly configured."

    message: "Code analysis for the Leaderboard Modal issue revealed two potential problems: 1) There's a duplicate condition for the 'leaderboard' action type in the handleActionClick function (lines 2669-2672), which might be causing confusion in the code execution. 2) The code is trying to make the leaderboard node (index 3) accessible for all users in the isBonusNodeAccessible function, but according to the bonusNodes array, the leaderboard is actually at index 4, not index 3. This could be why the leaderboard modal is not opening when clicked."
