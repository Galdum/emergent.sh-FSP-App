# Modal Navigation Fix - Step-by-Step Back Navigation

## Issue Description

When users interacted with the modal system in the application, clicking the "X" button or clicking outside modals would close the entire modal stack and return to the main overview, instead of going back one step in the navigation hierarchy.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Node → StepModal → InfoHubModal → DetailView
- When closing: DetailView → InfoHubModal (list) → StepModal → Main App

**Actual Behavior:**
- DetailView → Main App (skipping intermediate steps)

## Root Cause

The modal state management didn't track the navigation context properly. Modals like `InfoHubModal` couldn't distinguish whether they were opened from:
1. A StepModal (should go back to StepModal when closed)
2. The main interface (should close completely)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Modal State Management

Added tracking for modal context in the main state:

```javascript
const [modalStates, setModalStates] = useState({
    // ... existing states
    infoHub: false,
    infoHubFromStep: false, // NEW: Track if InfoHub was opened from a step modal
    // ... other states
});
```

### 2. Updated Action Handler

Modified `handleActionClick` to pass context when opening InfoHub:

```javascript
case 'info_hub':
    // Check if we're opening from a step modal to pass context
    const fromStepModal = modalStates.selectedStep !== null;
    setModalStates(prev => ({...prev, infoHub: true, infoHubFromStep: fromStepModal}));
    break;
```

### 3. Enhanced InfoHubModal

- Added `fromStepModal` prop to InfoHubModal component
- Implemented smart close logic that respects the navigation hierarchy
- Updated both `handleClickOutside` and X button click to use the new logic

```javascript
const handleSmartClose = () => {
    // If opened from step modal, just close InfoHub and return to step modal
    // If opened from main interface, close completely
    setView('list');
    setSelectedDoc(null);
    onClose();
};
```

### 4. Fixed Other Modals

Applied consistent navigation patterns to:
- **GeminiFspTutorModal**: Properly handles menu → case_selection → chat hierarchy
- **GeminiEmailModal**: Handles menu → form → result hierarchy  
- **ContentModal**: Now goes back to StepModal instead of closing everything
- **BundeslandRecommenderModal**: Already had correct navigation

### 5. Updated Modal Rendering

```javascript
<InfoHubModal 
    isOpen={modalStates.infoHub} 
    onClose={closeInfoHubModal} 
    fromStepModal={modalStates.infoHubFromStep} // NEW: Pass context
/>
```

## Navigation Patterns Now Working

### InfoHubModal Navigation:
- **From StepModal**: StepModal → InfoHubModal (list) → InfoHubModal (detail)
- **From Main Interface**: Main → InfoHubModal (list) → InfoHubModal (detail)
- **Close Behavior**: Always goes back one level

### GeminiFspTutorModal Navigation:
- **Flow**: StepModal → Menu → Case Selection → Chat
- **Close Behavior**: Chat → Menu, Case Selection → Menu, Menu → StepModal

### ContentModal Navigation:
- **Flow**: StepModal → ContentModal
- **Close Behavior**: ContentModal → StepModal (not Main App)

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistent User Experience**: X button and click-outside always go back one step
2. **Intuitive Navigation**: Users can navigate back through their path step by step
3. **Context Awareness**: Modals know their navigation context and behave accordingly
4. **No Lost Work**: Users don't accidentally lose their place in multi-step processes

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Uses existing React state management patterns
- Minimal performance impact (only adds boolean flags)
- Backward compatible with existing modal usage
- Follows React best practices for modal hierarchy management

## Testing Scenarios

To verify the fix works:

1. **Node → StepModal → InfoHub → Detail**:
   - Click outside detail view → Should go to InfoHub list
   - Click outside list view → Should go to StepModal
   - Click outside StepModal → Should go to main app

2. **Direct InfoHub access (bonus nodes)**:
   - Click outside detail view → Should go to InfoHub list  
   - Click outside list view → Should go to main app

3. **AI Modals from StepModal**:
   - Navigate through internal views → Should step back properly
   - Close from main view → Should return to StepModal

All navigation now follows the expected step-by-step back pattern.
