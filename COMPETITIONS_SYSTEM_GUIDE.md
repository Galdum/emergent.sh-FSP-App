### 3. Competition Workflow
1. User clicks "ParticipÄƒ" on an active competition
2. Competition modal shows details and game information
3. User clicks "ÃŽncepe" to start the quiz
4. Quiz runs with competition-specific settings
5. Results are processed with bonus points for high scores
6. User's XP and rankings are updated

### 4. Gamification Integration
- **Base Points**: Standard quiz completion points via gamification manager
- **Competition Bonuses**: Additional points for achieving minimum scores

## How Competitions Work

### 1. Competition Entry
```javascript
// User clicks "ParticipÄƒ" button
const startCompetition = (competition) => {
  setActiveCompetition(competition);
};
```

### 2. Quiz Start
```javascript
// User clicks "ÃŽncepe" in competition modal
const handleCompetitionStart = () => {
  if (activeCompetition && activeCompetition.gameType) {
    setActiveCompetition(null);
    startMiniGame(activeCompetition.gameType);
  }
};
```

### 3. Results Processing
```javascript
// Quiz completion with competition bonuses
const handleMiniGameComplete = (result) => {
  const gameResult = gamificationManager.completeQuiz(result.totalQuestions, result.correctAnswers);
  
  // Find competition and apply bonuses
  const currentCompetition = competitions.find(comp => comp.gameType === activeMiniGame);
  if (currentCompetition && result.score >= currentCompetition.minScore) {
    const competitionBonus = currentCompetition.bonusPoints;
    gamificationManager.awardPoints('competition_bonus', competitionBonus);
  }
  
  // Update user rankings
  updateUserRankings(gameResult.points + competitionBonus);
};
```

## Adding New Competitions

### Step 1: Add Questions
Edit `frontend/src/data/competitionQuestions.js`:

```javascript
// Add new quiz type
newQuiz: {
  title: "ðŸŽ¯ New Quiz Title",
  timeLimit: 1,
  description: "Quiz description",
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Your question here?",
      options: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Explanation for correct answer"
    }
    // ... more questions
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Add Competition Configuration
```javascript
// Add to competitionConfig.competitions array
{
  id: 4,
  title: "New Competition Title",
  description: "Competition description",
  participants: 0,
  timeLimit: 300,
  reward: "100 XP + Badge",
  status: "active",
  endsIn: "24h",
  gameType: "newQuiz",
  minScore: 75,
  bonusPoints: 40
}
```

### Step 3: Update UI (if needed)
- Add new quiz type to `quizTypes` array in CompetitionAdmin.js
- Update competition modal descriptions if needed

## Admin Management

### Current Approach
- **File-based**: Questions and configurations stored in `competitionQuestions.js`
- **Version Control**: Changes tracked through Git
- **Manual Updates**: Admins edit the configuration file directly

### Future Enhancements
- **Database Integration**: Store questions and configurations in database
- **Admin Panel**: Full CRUD interface for managing competitions
- **Real-time Updates**: Live competition management without code changes
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed competition statistics and user performance

## Competition Data Structure

### Competition Object
```javascript
{
  id: 1,                           // Unique identifier

  description: "Description",      // Competition details
  participants: 24,                // Current participant count
  timeLimit: 60,                   // Time limit in seconds
  reward: "150 XP + Badge",        // Reward description
  status: "active",                // "active" or "starting"
  endsIn: "2h 15min",             // Time remaining
  gameType: "fachbegriffe",        // Links to quiz type
  minScore: 80,                    // Minimum score for bonus
  bonusPoints: 50                  // Bonus points awarded
}
```

### Question Object
```javascript
{
  question: "Question text?",
  options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
  correctAnswer: 0,                // Index of correct option
  explanation: "Why this is correct"
}
```
